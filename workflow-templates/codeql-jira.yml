# This workflow will run the CodeQL suite of security and quality scans on your repository
# leveraging langages specified by the user and create associated scanning results in Jira Issues
# For a full readout of langauges supported by CodeQL
# refer to https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Specify Scanning languages
# CodeQL requires an input list of languages to be specified
# Replace 'csharp' in the language matrix to select the languages in your code base
#
# 2. Provide Jira Context
# In your repository's actions secrets, provide the base url (JIRA_BASE_URL), 
# user email (JIRA_USER_EMAIL), and api token (JIRA_API_TOKEN) associated with your Jira instance. 
#
# 3. Identify Jira Project
# Provide the abbreviation of the desired Jira project (JIRA_PROJECT_NAME)
